#Weather for Surf and Shake in Oahu


## Overview of the statistical analysis
This week we have been assisting W. Avy in his dream of opening a Surf and Shake store in Oahu, Hawaii.  He wants to show his investors that Oahu has consistently beautiful weather year round, enough for his shop to flourish.  To this end, we have analyzed the weather at opposite ends of the year, for the months of June and December over several years. 


### Results:
The statistical analysis shows that Oahu has remarkably homogenous weather.  This is great news for W. Avy, who will be able to demonstrate conclusively that the weather will not deter surfers or ice cream eaters on most days. December is slightly cooler, wetter, and less sunny than June. Below are summary statistics for June and December temperatures.

#### Key takeaways from comparing June and December temperature statistics
- The average temperatures for June (74.94°) and December (71.04°) are only different by roughly 4°! And both average temperatures are over 70°. 
- The coldest temperature in the dataset is 56°. It never gets very cold in Oahu at all. In fact, the 25th percentile of temperature in December is 69°, which means that 75% of the time it is 69° or more.  It never gets too cold for ice cream there.
- December gets almost just as warm as June. The maximum temperatures in the two months are very close, 85° for June and 83° for December.

## Summary:
Oahu is the perfect place for a surf and shake shop.  It never gets really cold there, and the temperature is consistent in the winter and in the summer. To further support this conclusion, we did a statistical analysis of precipitation for June and December. Below are the summary tables:

#### December Precipitation Summary Statistics

### Precipitation Analysis
Again, we can see that there is very little difference in the weather measurements.  On average, there is 0.1 more inches of rain on the average December day than on the average June day. 

## Side by Side
Finally, let's look at some graphs side by side and see how very similar the weather is in June and December in Oahu.

Notice that the scale on the left maxes out at 0.20 inches of rain!

### Comparison of percentage of mostly sunny days in June and December
![pct mostly sunny bar graph](https://github.com/mgsrichard/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/avg_pct_sunny_compare.png)

For the purposes of this graph, a day is considered mostly sunny if it received 0.15 inches of rain or less.
